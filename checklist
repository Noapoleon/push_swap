INTERROGATIONS:
	- what if the list is one element long ?
	- would padding the struct make the program faster ?
	- do double instructions count as one only in the operation count ? e.g.: rr = ra + rb

TESTS:
	- [DONE] int/long max/min
	- [DONE] int/long max/min + 1
	- [DONE] int/long max/min -1
	- [DONE] empty string
	- [DONE] multiple negative signs
	- [DONE] positive signs
	- [DONE] multiple positive signs
	- [DONE] letters
	-

TO IMPLEMENT:
	- [NO] ps_terminate : terminates push_swap program with exit mode (not sure it's necessary)
	- [DOING] sometimes a portion is already sorted properly but will be split by the recursive calls
	  because it doesn't check, so make is_sorted_list for quicksort_a and b, reverse order for b because pushing to a will invert it

CONSIDER:
	- [NO] If the size of the list is small enough it might be beneficial to use
	  normal arrays instead so check if it's worth it to implement it aswell
	- [NO] Right now push and swap functions have checks in them (null checks and
	  stuff) in case of errors when making the algorithm, my thinking is that
	  these checks could potentially be avoided once the algorithm is perfect.
	  Now the question is can I make the sorting algorithm without using BOTH
	  the size of the array AND the null checks
	- [NO] deference stack 'a' in a variable to make 'parse_ints()' faster?
	- [NEW SORT] think to properly handle extreme cases when list is small or
	  PS_FRACTIONS is big

CHECKER:
	- haven't checked for leaks
	- haven't checked if list is still the same same
	- haven't checked if sorting duplicated elements, theorically if it
	  duplicated elements the order check should find it and send an error
	- [IMP] CHECKER HAS LEAKS WHEN ENCOUNTERING ERRORS
