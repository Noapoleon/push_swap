INTERROGATIONS:
	- what if the list is one element long ?

TESTS:
	- int/long max/min
	- int/long max/min + 1
	- int/long max/min -1
	- empty string
	- multiple negative signs
	- positive signs
	- multiple positive signs
	- letters
	-

TO IMPLEMENT:
	- ps_terminate : terminates push_swap program with exit mode (not sure it's necessary)

CONSIDER:
	- If the size of the list is small enough it might be beneficial to use
	  normal arrays instead so check if it's worth it to implement it aswell
	- Right now push and swap functions have checks in them (null checks and
	  stuff) in case of errors when making the algorithm, my thinking is that
	  these checks could potentially be avoided once the algorithm is perfect.
	  Now the question is can I make the sorting algorithm without using BOTH
	  the size of the array AND the null checks
