INTERROGATIONS:
	- what if the list is one element long ?

TESTS:
	- int/long max/min
	- int/long max/min + 1
	- int/long max/min -1
	- empty string
	- multiple negative signs
	- positive signs
	- multiple positive signs
	- letters
	-

TO IMPLEMENT:
	- ps_terminate : terminates push_swap program with exit mode (not sure it's necessary)

CONSIDER:
	- If the size of the list is small enough it might be beneficial to use
	  normal arrays instead so check if it's worth it to implement it aswell
